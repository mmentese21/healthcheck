# 🧠 Disease Detection NLP Pipeline

A machine learning pipeline for detecting diseases based on patient symptom descriptions using Bio_ClinicalBERT and spaCy preprocessing.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `train_classifier.py` — fine-tunes Bio_ClinicalBERT on your dataset
- `detect_disease.py` — runs predictions on test samples
- `train.csv` — your labeled dataset (index, label, text)
- `disease_classifier/` — saved model, tokenizer, and label map

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
